# Use

## Terraform
1. Install terraform (on a mac, `brew install terraform`).
2. Install ansible (at time of writing, `pip install ansible`).
3. Create a variables.tf file under `/infrastructure` which contains 2 variables called `aws_access_key` and `aws_secret_key`, and one keypair called `jm`
4. You can now create the infrastructure by going into /terraform and running `terraform apply`.

## Ansible
1. Set two env variables `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`
2. Check that the dynamic inventory is working by issuing `./ec2.py --list` in the `ansible` directory
3. Set ANSIBLE_HOSTS environment variable to the path of ec2.py file
4. Try pinging the infrastructure. ansible -m ping --user=ubuntu --private-key=--REPLACE-- tag_Name_Etcd_Jean_Marie
